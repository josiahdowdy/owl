# owl
An interactive html, css, js, &amp; jQuery piece of owl art.

Hover over the moon or cloud to change the background picture, the owl image, and the sounds that are played. 

Unhover and everything will return back to normal. You can also hover over the owl to see changes.

A weather API is loaded in that checks the user current location and loads the time. I would like to use this to implement a
time based feature that changes images. For example, load the sunset & sunrise times and change images to a night time image
after sunset in the user's location.

The "frame" around the owl is CSS divs. Randomnly generated lines are there to mimick wood, although they could use improvement.
I would like to rethink the design of the frame, perhaps move it to the outside of the whole piece to mimick modern art in a frame.

Things to do:
New moon image
New sun image
New owl
Animated owl (flying, beak moving, gliding, flapping wings) in Spine Esoteric
Change background image based on sunset/sunrise time
New background image
optimize for phone screens (as well as pressing on a phone screen)
Update weather based on current weather conditions (for example, if it is raining in user area, make rain on owl)
